Notes on GEB
These are my notes on GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An eternal golden braid

I finished this tome of a book in May 2020, I picked it up on a whim and found out that it is more than a book that needs to be read casually, so I devoted 10 days reading the entire book and found a few interesting insights from it.
There is a strong community that harbours intense feelings for this text but I took it as a book which can provide insights into how the world around us is structured and what we might see as imperfections i.e. loopiness, recursion, and incompleteness are the rules on which the world is built.
